## 功能详解 (Features in Detail)

This plugin offers several ways to import and manage your Flomo notes within Obsidian:

- **多种同步方式 (Multiple Sync Methods):**
  - **启动时自动同步 (Auto Sync On Startup):** Enable this in settings to automatically sync when Obsidian starts.
  - **每小时自动同步 (Hourly Auto Sync):** Enable this in settings for automatic background sync every hour.
  - **手动同步 (Adhoc Sync / Manual Sync):**
    - **自动导出与导入 (Auto Export & Import):** Click the "Sync Now" button in the plugin UI. This uses Playwright to log in to Flomo, export your notes as HTML, and import them.
    - **手动导入 (Manual Import):** Export your notes as HTML (`flomo_backup.zip`) from the Flomo website yourself, then select the zip file in the plugin UI to import.
- **增量同步 (Incremental Sync):** The core feature. The plugin intelligently identifies and imports only *new* memos since the last sync, preventing duplicates. It remembers which memos have been imported.
- **自定义导入位置 (Customizable Import Location):** Specify the target folder in your Obsidian vault for imported Flomo notes (`Flomo Target`) and a subfolder for individual memos (`Memo Target`).
- **支持高亮标记 (Highlight Support):** Correctly converts Flomo's `<mark>` tags to Obsidian's `==highlight==` syntax.
- **Obsidian 集成 (Obsidian Integrations):**
  - **Flomo Canvas:** Optionally generates an Obsidian Canvas file visualizing your memos, either linking to the memo files or embedding the content directly.
  - **Flomo Moments:** Optionally generates a `Flomo Moments.md` file that embeds links to all imported memo files, providing a chronological overview.
- **实验性功能 (Experimental Features):**
  - **双向链接支持 (Bi-directional Link Support):** Attempts to preserve `[[wiki-links]]` within your memo content during import.
  - **按日期合并笔记 (Merge Memos by Date):** Option to merge all memos from the same day into a single Obsidian note, separated by `---`.

## 同步逻辑详解 (Synchronization Logic Explained)

Understanding how synchronization works, especially incrementally:

1.  **触发 (Trigger):** Sync can be triggered automatically (on startup, hourly timer via `main.ts`) or manually (clicking "Sync Now" in `main_ui.ts` or using the "Sync Flomo Now" command).
2.  **导出 (Export - Auto Sync/Sync Now Button):**
    *   The `FlomoExporter` utilizes Playwright (a browser automation tool) to:
        *   Log in to your Flomo account (using credentials potentially stored securely).
        *   Navigate to the export page.
        *   Download the full backup as an HTML file (saved to a location defined in `const.ts`, e.g., `DOWNLOAD_FILE`).
3.  **导入入口 (Import Entry Point):**
    *   The `FlomoImporter` class is instantiated.
    *   The `importFlomoFile` method is called, passing the path to the downloaded HTML file (`DOWNLOAD_FILE`).
4.  **数据读取与解析 (Data Reading & Parsing):**
    *   `FlomoImporter` reads the HTML file content.
    *   It calls `FlomoCore`'s constructor, passing the HTML data and the list of already synced memo IDs (`syncedMemoIds`) loaded from the plugin's saved settings (`this.settings.syncedMemoIds`).
5.  **核心处理与增量识别 (`FlomoCore`):**
    *   The constructor parses the HTML structure.
    *   The `loadMemos` method iterates through each memo element (`<div class="memo">`).
    *   **Crucially for Incremental Sync:** For *each* memo found in the HTML, a unique `memoId` is generated. This ID is based on a combination of:
        *   The memo's exact timestamp.
        *   A hash of its content (title, body, attachments).
        *   A counter for memos with the *exact same timestamp* (to differentiate them).
        *   An overall sequential counter.
    *   This generated `memoId` is compared against the `syncedMemoIds` list received from the settings.
    *   **If the ID is NOT in the list:** It's considered a **new memo**. Its `memoId` is added to the *instance's* `syncedMemoIds` list, `newMemosCount` is incremented, and the memo's data is added to the `memos` array to be processed.
    *   **If the ID IS in the list:** It's skipped.
6.  **写入 Obsidian (`FlomoImporter.importFlomoFile`):**
    *   The method receives the processed data from `FlomoCore`, including the list of *only the newly identified* memos.
    *   It groups these new memos by date.
    *   Based on the "Merge Memos by Date" setting, it writes the content of each new memo (or merged content) to the appropriate file path within the specified `Flomo Target` and `Memo Target` folders in your vault.
    *   It potentially calls `generateMoments` and `generateCanvas` if enabled.
7.  **状态保存 (State Saving - `main.ts`):**
    *   After `importFlomoFile` completes, the plugin calls `saveSettings()`.
    *   This saves the updated `syncedMemoIds` list (which now includes the IDs of the newly imported memos) and the current `lastSyncTime` back into Obsidian's persistent storage for this plugin. This ensures the *next* sync knows about these newly added memos.
8.  **通知 (Notification):** A notice is displayed indicating how many memos were found and how many were newly imported.

This detailed ID generation and checking process is the key to reliable incremental synchronization, ensuring only new content is added to your Obsidian vault.

## 🔄 Upgrading from Version 1.x to 2.0

If you're upgrading from an older version, the attachment path structure has changed. You have two options:

### Option A: Clean Re-import (Recommended)

1. Open Flomo Importer settings
2. Click the **"Reset Sync History"** button
3. Manually delete these old folders in your vault:
   - `[Flomo Home]/memos/` (e.g., `flomo/memos/` or `10 flomo/memos/`)
   - `[Flomo Home]/flomo picture/` (if exists)
4. Run sync again
5. All memos and attachments will be re-imported with the new, cleaner structure

### Option B: Keep Existing Memos

1. Just sync normally
2. Only new memos will be imported with the new attachment structure
3. Old memos keep their old attachment paths
4. Result: Mixed structure, but nothing breaks

**Note:** Content update detection works automatically. If you edit a memo in Flomo after upgrading, it will be detected and re-imported.

<br />

## Plugin Settings

You can customize the following options in the plugin settings page:

- **Auto Sync On Startup**: Automatically sync when Obsidian is launched.
- **Auto Sync Interval**: Automatically sync every hour.
- **Incremental Sync**: Skip already imported memos and only import new ones.
- **Merge Memos by Date**: Merge multiple memos from the same day into a single file.
- **Flomo Target**: Folder in Obsidian vault to store Flomo memos (default: `flomo`).
- **Memo Target**: Subfolder under Flomo folder to store individual memos (default: `memos`).
- **Canvas & Moments Options**: Select display options for Flomo Canvas and Moments.
- **Reset Sync History**: Clear all synced memo IDs to re-import all memos (useful after changing paths).
